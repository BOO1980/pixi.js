	<li>Container is an empty box that will group together and store what you put in it</li>
	<li>As soon as you have a renderer, you can start adding images to it</li>
	<li>Anything you want to be made visible in the renderer has to be added to a special Pixi object called the stage</li>
	<li>The stage is a Pixi container object: Like an empty box that will group together and store what you put inside it</li>
	<li>The stage objec is the root container for all the visible things in your scene</li>
	<li>A Pixi container has the same properties and methods as any other Container object.</li>
	<li>Although the stahe has width and height properties, they don't refer to the size of the rendering window</li>
	<li>The stage's width and height properties just tell you the area occupies by the things you put inside it</li>

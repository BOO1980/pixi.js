	<ul><li>A texture atlas becomes really useful if you are working on a big complex game you would want a fast efficient way to create sprites from tilesets</li>
		<li>A texture atlas is a JSON data file that contains the positions and sizes of sub-images on a matching tileset PNG image</li>
		<li>You can arrange yoru tileset images in any order and the JSON file will keep track of their sizes and positions for you</li>
		<li>This means the sizes and postions of tileset images arent hard-coded into your game program</li>

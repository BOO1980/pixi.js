<h1>Sprites</h1>
<ul><li>Sprites are image objects that you put in the stage</li>
	<li>Sprites are images that you can control with code</li>
	<li>You can control there position, size and a host of other properties that are useful for making interactive and animated graphics.</li>
	<li>Learning to make sprites and add them to stage is the most important thing about learning to us Pixi</li>
	<li>If you know how to make sprites and add them to the stage, you're just a small step away from starting to make games.</li>
	<li>Pixi has a sprite class that is a versitile way to make game sprites.  There are 3 main ways to create them<ul><li>
		From a single image file</li>
		<li>From a sub-image on a tileset:  A tileset is a single, big image that includes all the images you will need in the game.
	</li>
	<li>From a texture atlas(A JSON file that defines the size and position of an image on a tileset.)</li>
	<li>For optimization and efficiency it is always best to make a sprite from a texture that's been pro-loaded into Pixi's texture cache.</li>
	<li>If for some reason you need to make a texture from a regular JavaScript Image object you can do this using Pixi's BaseTexture and Texture</li>

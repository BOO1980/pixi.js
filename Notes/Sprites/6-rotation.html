	<h1>Rotation</h1>
	<ul>
		<li>You can make a sprite rotate by setting its rotation property to a value in radians</li>
		<li>The anchor point you've seen that a sprites top left corner represents its x and y position</li>
		<li>The rotation will happen around the spirtes anchor point</li>
		<li>To change the anchor point to the centre, use the 0.5;</li>
		<li>The anchor.x and anchor.y values represent a percentage of the textures dimensions from 0 to 1 (0% to 100%)</li>
		<li>Spirtes also have a pivot property which works in a similar way to anchor</li>
		<li>Pivot sets the position of the sprites x/y origin point</li>
